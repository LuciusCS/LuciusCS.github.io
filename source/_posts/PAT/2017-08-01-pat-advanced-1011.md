With the 2010 FIFA World Cup running, football fans the world over were becoming increasingly excited as the best players from the best teams doing battles for the World Cup trophy in South Africa. Similarly, football betting fans were putting their money where their mouths were, by laying all manner of World Cup bets.

Chinese Football Lottery provided a "Triple Winning" game. The rule of winning was simple: first select any three of the games. Then for each selected game, bet on one of the three possible results -- namely W for win, T for tie, and L for lose. There was an odd assigned to each result. The winner's odd would be the product of the three odds times 65%.

For example, 3 games' odds are given as the following:

 W    T    L

1.1  2.5  1.7

1.2  3.0  1.6

4.1  1.2  1.1

To obtain the maximum profit, one must buy W for the 3rd game, T for the 2nd game, and T for the 1st game. If each bet takes 2 yuans, then the maximum profit would be (4.1*3.0*2.5*65%-1)*2 = 37.98 yuans (accurate up to 2 decimal places).

Input

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains the betting information of 3 games. Each game occupies a line with three distinct odds corresponding to W, T and L.

Output

For each test case, print in one line the best bet of each game, and the maximum profit accurate up to 2 decimal places. The characters and the number must be separated by one space.

Sample Input

1.1 2.5 1.7

1.2 3.0 1.6

4.1 1.2 1.1

Sample Output

T T W 37.98

### 题目要求

题目中给了一大堆规则，其实就是查找到每一行的最大值将它们相乘，计算结果=（相乘的结果*65%-1）X2，计算结果保留两位小数；输出最大值所对应的的列，以及将计算结果；

### 解题思路

设置一个结果变量result，找出每一行中的最大的数与结果变量相乘result *= tmp，可以避免每次查找都需要对最大的数进行记录；然后记录位置，将最大的数对应的结果类型赋值给 outChar[3];

```c

#include "stdio.h"
#include "stdlib.h"


int main()
{
	char line[3] = {'W','T','L'};
	char outChar[3];

	int index;
	float in,tmp;
	float result=1;


	for (int  i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	{
		index = 0;
		tmp = 0;
		for (int j = 0; j <3; j++)
		{
			scanf("%f",&in);
			if (tmp<in)
			{
				tmp = in;
				index = j;
			}

		}
		result *= tmp;
		outChar[i]=line[index];

	}
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	{
		printf("%c ",outChar[i]);
	}
	
	printf("%.2f", (result*0.65 - 1) * 2);
	system("pause");
	return 0;
}
```
